<h2>Lesson 1: Lists</h2>
<p>A list is a neat way to store a collection of multiple objects. Lists in python can hold any data type. In fact, lists themselves are a data type, so lists can store other lists!</p>
<p>Lists are denoted with square brackets, like so:</p>
<p><code>['these', 'are', 6, 'elements', 'of', ['a', 'list', False]]</code></p>
<p>Lists share quite a lot of useful features with strings. For example, it's possible to see if something is a member of a list using the keywords <code>in</code> and <code>not in</code>. Lists can also be combined with the <code>+</code> operator and repeated with the <code>*</code> operator. And, just like strings, accessing an element from a list is done with indexing. As far as built-in python functions go, <code>len()</code>, <code>min()</code>, <code>max()</code>, and <code>sum()</code> all work as their names suggest with lists.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Write a function <code>listDouble</code> that takes a list <code>items</code>, doubles it, finds the length of the resulting list and prints <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> whether the newly calculated length is a member of the list or not.</p>
<h4>Sample Input 0</h4>
<p><code>listDouble(['e', 78, 4, True, 10])</code></p>
<h4>Sample Output 0</h4>
<p><code>True</code></p>
