<h2>Lesson 3: Advanced Operators</h2>
<p>Okay, so our four basic arithmetic operators are a walk in the park. A lot of the tasks we need to do in python require some more complicated techniques, however. Let's talk about some of the other operators available to us.</p>
<p>The division <code>/</code> operator that we used previously is great, but it turns values like <code>11/3</code> into big ugly numbers with lots of decimal points. Sometimes we only want to know how many times our number divided evenly, and the integer division <code>//</code> operator does exactly that. Now, <code>11//3</code> is a nice even 3. Notice that no rounding is taking place, python simply removed everything past the decimal point!</p>
<p>What if we wanted to know how much of the number didn't round evenly? The modulo <code>%</code> operator would be a great place to start. It gives us the remainder of any division operation. For example, <code>7%2</code> is 1. Mod 2 is very useful for determining if a number is even or odd!</p>
<p>The last extra operator we'll want to be using is the exponent <code>**</code> operator. Many people are familiar with representing exponents with a <code>^</code>, but that does something different in python. Exponents are useful for obvious reasons. Try it out with <code>2**5</code> to get 32.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Write a function <code>advOperators</code> that accepts two numbers and prints their integer quotient, remainder, and power, in that order.</p>
<h4>Sample Input 0</h4>
<p><code>advOperators(5, 2)</code></p>
<h4>Sample Output 0</h4>
<p><code>2<br />1<br />25</code></p>
