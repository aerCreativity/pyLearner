<h2>Lesson 2: Arithmetic</h2>
<p>Let's get familiar with numbers and how to mess with them! Integers and floats are two more types of data that can be stored in python. In fact, to find out what data type something is, you can use the function <code>type()</code> like we did with <code>print()</code> earlier.</p>
<p>Integers represent whole numbers and floats represent fractions, although you'll find you can generally treat them interchangeably. We can also do operations on these number types, just like in math. Our most familiar ones, namely <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, and <code>/</code>, are a great way to test that we're doing things right.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Write a function <code>operators</code> that accepts two numbers <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, and prints their sum, difference, product, and quotient, in that order.</p>
<h4>Sample Input 0</h4>
<p><code>operators(1, 2)</code></p>
<h4>Sample Output 0</h4>
<p><code>3<br />
-1<br />
2<br />
0.5</code></p>
