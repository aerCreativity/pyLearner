<h2>Lesson 7: Variance</h2>
<p>We've seen some use of variables so far since just about every function we've written up to this point has used them. It's equally, if not more important, to make and use your own! Variables consist of letters, numbers, and some special characters like dash and underscore, although they can't start with numbers. It's always a good idea to name variables after what they represent, otherwise things could get confusing very easily. Take the following sample program:</p>
<p><code>kiloConversion = 1.609<br />print("10 miles in kilos:", 10*kiloConversion)</code></p>
<p>Variables are particularly great whenever repetition is required. If someone needed to convert a lot of different mile values, they would choose to use our <code>kiloCoversion</code> variable because it's much easier to follow what it means than the number 1.609 magically appearing in their code.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Write a function <code>fahrToCels</code> that accepts three floats <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>, and prints their values converted to celsius. Use a variable in your solution that stores the value of the fahrenheit to celsius conversion ratio.</p>
<h4>Sample Input 0</h4>
<p><code>fahrToCels(67, 32, -40)</code></p>
<h4>Sample Output 0</h4>
<p><code>21.0<br />0.0<br />-40.0</code></p>
