<h2>Lesson 8: Strings</h2>
<p>We talked briefly before about strings, but let's get a little more in depth. A <code>string</code> in python is wrapped in either single or double quotes, and stores text as a 'string' of characters. Strings have operators and functions that we can employ to play with them. Adding two strings together with the <code>+</code> symbol concatenates the strings together, and multiplying a string with a number concatenates that string with itself as many times as the number provided. Finding the length of a string is done with the built-in python function <code>len()</code>. Finding what letter in a string is at a certain position is done with indexing like <code>'hello'[2]</code>, and finally whether a string is in another string can be determined by the <code>in</code> keyword in python. That last one especially is a huge help!</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Write a function <code>concatIn</code> that takes three strings <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>, and prints whether or not the concatenation of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> is in <code>z</code>.</p>
<h4>Sample Input 0</h4>
<p><code>concatIn("abc", "def", "qwerty")</code></p>
<h4>Sample Output 0</h4>
<p><code>False</code></p>
