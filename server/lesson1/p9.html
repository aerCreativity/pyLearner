<h2>Lesson 9: The Index</h2>
<p>Indexing things like strings in python is a crucial skill. It allows us to access letters from certain positions in the sequence. Interestingly, the counting actually starts from 0 when it comes to indexing. So, the first letter has an index of 0, the second has an index of 1, and so on. Python is also extra nice and lets us index backwards! This, however, starts from -1, not 0. That means, the last letter has an index of -1, the second to last has an index of -2, and so on.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the previous exercise, indexing is done by using square brackets on a string. Try combining it with our other newfound knowledge below.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Write a function <code>everyOther</code> that takes a single string <code>s</code>, which is guaranteed to be 6 characters long, and combines the 2nd, 4th and 6th indices and prints the result.</p>
<h4>Sample Input 0</h4>
<p><code>everyOther("davida")</code></p>
<h4>Sample Output 0</h4>
<p><code>aia</code></p>
