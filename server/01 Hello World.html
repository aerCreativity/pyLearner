<h2>Lesson 1: Hello World</h2>
<p>To make sure that you're set up properly, let's start with a simple Hello World script. Printing things in python can be achieved with the built in function print(), used like so:<br /><br /><code>print("Hello!")<br /></code><br />You'll notice that we put our phrase in quotes, which tells python that we're working with a data type called a string. As we go on, we'll encounter more data types and their uses, but strings are a great place to start!</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Write a function that prints Hello, World!</p>
<h4>Sample Output 0</h4>
<p><code>Hello, World!</code></p>
