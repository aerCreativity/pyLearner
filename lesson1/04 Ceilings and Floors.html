<h2>Lesson 4: Ceilings and Floors</h2>
<p>For our last bit with numbers, we'll explore a couple more built-in functions that python has to offer for us. The <code>min()</code> and <code>max()</code> functions can find us the smallest and largest values when given some data. This is also a good time to bring up arguments; back when we used <code>print()</code> we only gave it one value, like so:</p>
<p><code>print("Hello!")</code></p>
<p>The print function actually accepts multiple values, called arguments, which are separated by commas, for example:</p>
<p><code>print("Hello", "friends!")</code></p>
<p>For <code>min()</code> and <code>max()</code> to be of any use, they will of course need to accept multiple arguments. Go ahead and try it out in the exercise. We also have access to the abs() function, which gives us the absolute value of a given number.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Write a function <code>absMax</code> that accepts three numbers <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>, and prints the maximum of their absolute values.</p>
<h4>Sample Input 0</h4>
<p><code>absMax(2, -6, 3)</code></p>
<h4>Sample Output 0</h4>
<p><code>6</code></p>
